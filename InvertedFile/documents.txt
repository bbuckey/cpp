the goals overall structure and approach of this sixth edition of concepts of programming languages remain the same as those of the five earlier editions
*
the principal goal is to provide the reader with the tools necessary for the critical evaluation of existing and future programming languages
*
an additional goal is to prepare the reader for the study of compiler design
*
there were several sources of our motivations for the changes in the sixth edition
*
first to maintain the currency of the material much of the discussion of older programming languages has been removed
*
in its place is material on newer languages
*
especially interesting historical information on older programming languages has been retained but placed in historical side boxes
*
second the material has been updated to reflect the fact that most students now come to this course with a basic understanding of object oriented programming
*
we shortened the discussion of basics and expanded the discussion of advanced topics
